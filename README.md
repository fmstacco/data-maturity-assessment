# **Data Maturity Assessment - Project Portfolio 2 - JavaScript**

Data Maturity Assessment is a tool that will help small and medium -sized companies evaluate the maturity level of their data management. This evaluation will indicate at what stage the company is in data management as well as ways to improve company data maturity. The idea of this quiz was on the future features list of the [Project Portfolio 1](https://github.com/fmstacco/Carpe-Diem-Data-Solutions), therefore, this project inherits the style and some of the same code for some sections, such as logo, typography, footer, form among others.  

Welcome to the live site here: <a href="https://fmstacco.github.io/data-maturity-assessment/" target="_blank">Data Maturity Assessment</a>

## Design Choices

 * ### Logo

 The logo was designed on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/en_gb/) version Pro. A machine learning icon was chosen to convey the core concept of business consulting - data analysis and data science. The logo is borrowed from PP1 - Carpe Diem Data Solutions, as this project was thought to be a continuity of [Project 1](https://github.com/fmstacco/Carpe-Diem-Data-Solutions). 

![Carpe Diem Data Solutions logo](./assets/images/readme/logo-dark-background.png) 

 * ### Typography
 
 The source used throughout the site is Montserrat, as it is a nice font, elegant and also conveys confidence and professionalism. It is very good for UX/UI for having good readability on any device, large x-heigh and is also good for accessibility. Also the typography is borrowed from PP1 - Carpe Diem Data Solutions, as this project was thought to be a continuity of [Project 1](https://github.com/fmstacco/Carpe-Diem-Data-Solutions). 

 * ### Colour Scheme

Colour Palette image

The colour palette idea is borrowed from PP1 - Carpe Diem Data Solutions, as this project was thought to be a continuity of [Project 1](https://github.com/fmstacco/Carpe-Diem-Data-Solutions).

# Future Features

The Data Maturity Assessment can be improved in the future through new features to be developed:

**Progress Bar** - A ***progress bar*** is a nice feature to show how far the user is in the process of answering the questionnaire. And is good for a better user experience.

**Short Assessment** - a ***quick*** assessment with fewer questions could be implemented in order to address potential customers who don’t have the time to answer the complete assessment. 

**Login** - for future development it would be nice to have a ***signup and login*** feature in order for the user to get the results. It would be great for the business to expand its mailing list of potential clients to offer its services. 

**404 Page** - it can be improved for better user experience UX/UI.
