## Design Choices

 * ### Logo

 The logo was designed on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/en_gb/) version Pro. A machine learning icon was chosen to convey the core concept of business consulting - data analysis and data science. The logo is borrowed from PP1 - Carpe Diem Digital Solutions, as this project was thought to be a continuity of [Project 1](https://github.com/fmstacco/Carpe-Diem-Data-Solutions). 

![Carpe Diem Data Solutions logo](./assets/images/readme/logo-dark-background.png) 

 * ### Typography
 
 The source used throughout the site is Montserrat, as it is a nice font, elegant and also conveys confidence and professionalism. It is very good for UX/UI for having good readability on any device, large x-heigh and is also good for accessibility. Also the typography is borrowed from PP1 - Carpe Diem Digital Solutions, as this project was thought to be a continuity of [Project 1](https://github.com/fmstacco/Carpe-Diem-Data-Solutions). 

 * ### Colour Scheme
